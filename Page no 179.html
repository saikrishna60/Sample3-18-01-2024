<h2 >Abstract</h2>

<p><i>The chapter introduces biomedical image registration as a means of integrating and<br/>
providing complementary and additional information from multiple medical images<br/>
simultaneously to facilitate diagnostic decision-making and treatment monitoring. It<br/>
focuses on the fundamental theories of biomedical image registration, major<br/>
methodologies and contributions of this area, and the main applications of biomedical<br/>
image registration in clinical contexts. Furthermore, discussions on the future challenges<br/>
and possible research trends of this field are presented. The chapter aims to assist in<br/>
a quick understanding of main methods and technologies, current issues, and major<br/>
applications of biomedical image registration, to provide the connection between<br/>
biomedical image registration and the related research areas, and finally to evoke<br/>
novel and practical registration methods to improve the quality and safety of healthcare.</i></p>
