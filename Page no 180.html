<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Clinical knowledge management is a challenging and broad discipline related to the<br/>
collection, processing, visualization, storage, preservation, and retrieval of health-<br/>
related data and information to form useful knowledge for making critical clinical<br/>
decisions. As an important part of clinical knowledge, medical images facilitate the<br/>
understanding of anatomy and function, and are critical to research and healthcare.<br/>
Medical imaging modalities can be divided into two major categories: anatomical<br/>
modalities and functional modalities.</p>

<p>natomical modalities, mainly depicting morphology, include X-ray, computed tomog-<br/>
raphy (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US). Functional modalities,<br/>
primarily describing information on the biochemistry of the underlying anatomy, include<br/>
single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomog-<br/>
raphy (PET). With the advances in medical imaging technologies, these imaging modali-<br/>
ties are playing a more and more important role in improving the quality and efficiency<br/>
of healthcare. For example, the functional imaging techniques can be used to image<br/>
physiological and biochemical processes in different organs, such as brain, lung, liver,<br/>
bone, thyroid, heart, and kidney (Figure 1). In such clinical settings, PET aids clinicians<br/>
in choosing the most appropriate treatment and monitoring the patientsâ€™ response to<br/>
these therapies. Since information from multiple medical imaging modalities is usually of<br/>
a complementary nature, proper extraction registration of the embedded information and<br/>
knowledge is important in the healthcare decision making process and in clinical practice</p>

<p>The combination of more advanced and user-friendly medical image databases is making<br/>
medical imaging results more accessible to clinical professionals. Starting in the early<br/>
1990s, the Visible Human Project and Human Brain Project at the US National Library of<br/>
Medicine have produced a widely available reference of multimodal images of the human<br/>
body. These projects provide users with labeled data and the connection of structural-<br/>
anatomical knowledge with functional-physiological knowledge (Ackerman, 2001; Riva,<br/>
2003), and assist in making image data more usable for clinical training and surgery<br/>
simulation and planning. A significant step in these virtual reality projects is the<br/>
collection and registration of medical images from multiple imaging modalities.</p>

<p>Clinical practice often involves collecting and integrating considerable amounts of<br/>
multimodality medical imaging data over time intervals to improve the optimization and<br/>
precision of clinical decision making and to achieve better, faster, and more cost-effective<br/>
healthcare. For example, in neurosurgical planning, the proper registration of the<br/>
functional information with the detailed anatomical background enables the surgeon to<br/>
optimize the operation with minimal damage to the healthy organs. The accurate and<br/>
efficient registration of the complementary information available from different imaging<br/>
modalities provides a basis for diagnostic and medical decision-making, treatment<br/>
monitoring, and healthcare support.</p>

<p>A key issue in clinical knowledge management is biomedical image registration, which<br/>
provides an effective mechanism to integrate the relevant information and knowledge in<br/>
clinical and medical decision-making, operation planning, and image guided surgery.<br/>
Registration algorithms also offer new possibilities to analyze and visualize multimodal<br/>
image datasets simultaneously</p>
