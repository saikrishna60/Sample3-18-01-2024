<p>ystems and web-based communications. Technology innovation has spawned a pro-<br/>
liferation of communication and data devices, such as GPRS cellular phones and PDAs,<br/>
and with it a significant opportunity for accessing clinical information anywhere,<br/>
anytime, allowing healthcare practitioners to collaborate upon clinical information and<br/>
reach conclusions more effectively</p>
<p>Throughout the chapter a selection of technologies has been presented that can enable<br/>
healthcare personnel to interact in a variety of styles. These approaches demonstrated<br/>
how multimedia technologies can be harnessed to capture information and enable users<br/>
to collaborate in range of modes in an effective manner. It was also described how the<br/>
knowledge captured during collaboration interactions can be saved and archived for<br/>
future search, reference and reusability. In addition, technology support for home<br/>
healthcare nurses is presented that shows potential for streamlining the capture and<br/>
entry of information into the patient record.</p>
