<p>In addition to capturing an image, it is often desirable to be able to augment an image with<br/>
a synchronized audio commentary and associated pen markings to describe specific<br/>
aspects of the patientâ€™s condition. Hence, a multimedia annotation capability is offered<br/>
that can support this requirement and be stored along with the patient record</p>

<p>Current and future work includes conducting formal user studies with nursing practitio-<br/>
ners from two home healthcare agencies to evaluate the usability and efficacy of the<br/>
devices and approaches described above to inform the subsequent iteration of the<br/>
prototype design.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The manner in which a networked enterprise can facilitate a plethora of ways for<br/>
healthcare personnel to communicate and collaborate was explored within this chapter.<br/>
The next generation of communication technologies augurs well for converged voice and<br/>
data solutions on a single network. We anticipate a closer union between healthcare IT</p>
